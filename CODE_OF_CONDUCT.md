## The Goals

As the overall community of Horizon, we commit to making participation in open-source software open to all, free from harassment or other demeaning behavior.

We build free software for everyone, made possible by the time, effort, and support of countless people, including the people who use Horizon. That only works when people feel safe, respected, and able to collaborate without fear of hostility, discrimination, or retaliation.

Any form of discrimination whatsoever is never allowed, regardless of race, color, ethnicity, nationality, age, disability, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion (or lack of religion), political beliefs, level of experience, or personal appearance.

Harassment makes it difficult to maintain a sense of community and, as such, is strongly discouraged.

## The Standards

Horizon's Code of Conduct exists to establish shared expectations and "common sense" across all official Horizon spaces.

### Be excellent to each other

- **Be respectful.** Treat people as humans first. Don't attack people.
- **Be considerate.** Think about what you say before you say it. Your words can hurt others.
- **Be collaborative.** Assume good intent, ask questions, and work towards a shared goal.
- **Be supportive.** Help those around you, especially those new to the community!
- **Be constructive.** You should critique ideas, not people.

### Unacceptable behavior

- Any form of harassment, discrimination, derogatory comments, or hate speech.
  - This includes harassment in public spaces or private messages.
- Any sexual harassment or non-consensual sexual advances.
- Stalking, witch-hunting, threats, or blackmail.
- Encouraging the harm of others.
- Trolling, spam, or otherwise impeding the goals of the community (including persistent bad-faith arguing).
- Sharing someone's private information without permission, including personally identifying information (PII) as defined by the [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/).
- Posting chat logs, screenshots, or recordings without consent from the people involved. This does not include screenshots of public F-Chat channels (with no expectation of privacy), so long as it's not done to harass.
- Impersonation of contributors, maintainers, or official staff.
- Retaliation against someone who makes a COC report, whether in good faith or not.

---

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all official Horizon community spaces, including:

- ALL GitHub repositories owned by the `F-Chat Horizon` org, including issues, PRs, commits, etc.
- Official chat/community spaces (e.g., Discord, `#Horizon` on F-Chat). These communities may also enforce their own standards on top of this.
- Any event organized by the project.
- Any public space where someone is representing Horizon or acting in an official capacity, even if not directly within Horizon's spaces.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you feel someone has violated this COC within its scope, you are encouraged to report it.

- **Primary contact:** `dev@horizn.moe`
- **Alternate contact:** `rose@f-list.net`
- **F-Chat contact character:** `The Horizon Dev`

When reporting, include as much as you can:

- What occurred, where it occurred, and when it occurred.
- Who was involved (handles/usernames, but NOT F-Chat characters).
- Links, screenshots, or relevant context.

Reports are generally only shared between Horizon maintainers (@CodingWithAnxiety and @FatCatClient). Other Horizon staff in the Discord server may see them, and if the conduct is severe enough, we may involve platform staff or F-List staff. We do not publicly disclose reports.

### Possible actions

Depending on severity and context, maintainers may take action, including:

- A private request to stop the offending behavior.
- A formal warning within official Horizon spaces.
- Removing content (comments, issues, pull requests, etc.).
- Temporary restrictions on contributing to or being involved in Horizon spaces.
- Temporary suspension from Horizon spaces.
- Permanent ban from official Horizon spaces.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was taken incorrectly, you may appeal by contacting `dev@horizn.moe` or `The Horizon Dev` on F-List.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is informed by common open-source community standards, including the Contributor Covenant (v2.1), and takes inspiration from the [KDE Community Code of Conduct](https://kde.org/code-of-conduct/).
